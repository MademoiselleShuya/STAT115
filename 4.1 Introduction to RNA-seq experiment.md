RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is revolutionizing the study of the transcriptome.

1. Transcription and splicing

2. RNA-seq protocol

All RNA-Seq methods are based on the use of a reverse transcriptase to convert the RNA to cDNA. Two basic variations use either random primers or oligo(dT) primers for this reaction. Oligo(dT) primers are highly 3â€™ biased and mostly suitable for mRNA abundance (expression) analysis. Random primers also result in some bias, which can be reduced by fragmentation of the input RNA[1].

The workflow of the RNA-seq data generation: 

```
1. mRNA or total RNA
2. remove contaminant DNA
3. optional: reomve tRNA or rRNA
4. fragment RNA
5. reverse transcribe into cDNA
6. ligate sequencing adaptors(you can choose strand-specific RNA-seq)
7. PCR amplification
8. select a range of sizes
9. sequence cDNA ends
```

3. RNA-Seq allows researchers to detect:

```
1. examine the expression of all the genes in specific conditions(developmental stages, different tissues, normal vs disease, drug treatment, gene perturbation)
2. find novel genes or transcript
3. enable the detection of gene mutation, gene fusions, and single nucleotide variants
4. model alternative splicing
```

4. Benefits of RNA Sequencing:

```
It offers numerous advantages over gene expression arrays
1. Broader dynamic range enables more sensitive and accurate measurement of gene expression
2. Not limited by prior knowledge - captures both known and novel features
3. Can be applied to any species, even if reference sequencing is not available
4. A better value, often delivering advantages at a comparable or lower price per sample than many arrays(digital representation of gene expression
and good detection range(>10^5)from low to high expression level)
```
