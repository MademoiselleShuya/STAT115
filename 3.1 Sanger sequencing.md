**Frederick Sanger** (13 August 1918 – 19 November 2013) was an English [biochemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemist) who twice won the [Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry). In 1958, he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for his work on the [structure of proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure), especially that of [insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin)". In 1980, [Walter Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gilbert) and Sanger shared half of the chemistry prize "for their contributions concerning the determination of base [sequences in nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing)".



Ingredients：DNA(template strand and complimentary srand), DNA ploymerase, primers, 4 dNTPs(dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP)

1. Firstly, the DNA to be sequenced has to be amplified

3. Heal is then used to denature the DNA
4. a primer is then annealed to the 5‘end of the DNA
5. The primed DNA is then dispersed equally among four reaction vessels
6. Next, DNA ploymerase is added to all four of the reaction vessels

7. Followed by four dNTPs into each reaction vessel 
8. Specially modified ddNTPs are then added the reaction vessels, only one type of ddNTP is added to each reaction vessel
9. The ploymerase attaches the dNTPs to the template strand at the primer normally unitil ddNTP is base paired
10. Once the ddNTP is base paired, the sequence is terminated because the ddNTP lacks a Hydroxyl Group at the 3‘ Carbon
11. As a results of the chain termination, DNA fragments of different lengths are formed across all the reaction vessels
12. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is used to sequence the DNA  
13. DNA migrates from the negative pole towards the positive pole, due to the negative charge imparted by their phosphate backbone. the smaller, lighter lengths of DNA migrate further to the bottom of the electrophoresis plate
14. Polyacrylamide gel is used rather than Agarose gel because of its high resolving power, and it can separate DNA strands that differ in length by 1 base pair
15. The sequence is read from the bottom of the plate
16. This whole process results in the complementary sequence of the DNA sample
