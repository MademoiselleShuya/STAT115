1. RNA quality control

Not for fresh-made RNA sample( isolated from tissues and cell lines)

Degraded RNA (shorter) are hard to be made into a sequencing library

一般存储样品和处理过的样品，存在RNA降解的可能性，这时候质量控制就十分必要

RNA降解通常是从5‘端开始的，这也就为什么我们在对降解的RNA进行测序时，仍然可以看到3‘端的信息

Normally quality control should be performed before library preparation

DV200 is important for RNA QC and DV200 > 30% is recommended

2. Experimental design

ribo-minus(remove too abundant r/tRNA transcripts) 核糖-减(删除过多的r/tRNA转录本，即preRNA with introns)

PolyA(mRNA after splicing, enrich for exons, no tRNA/rRNA) PolyA(剪接后mRNA，富集外显子，无tRNA/rRNA)

Strand specific(Directionally of RNA, useful for novel lncRNA) 链特异性(RNA定向，适用于新型lncRNA)

3. Sequencing depth

Depth: 20-50M differently expression, deeper transcript assembly or splicing 

read length: longer for transcripts assembly, splicing mutation calls

4. assessing biological variation requires replicates:

technical(not needed): same RNA, library prep and sequencing separately

Bio1: cells grown in different dishes, processed on different days

Bio2: cells, tissues from different lab animals(genetically identical, similar age and lifestyle)

Bio3: cells / tissues from different human individuals

How many replicates are good enough:

1 only for exploratory assays, not good for publications

2 OK for cell line samples

3 preferred for animal samples

more for human smaples

NOTE: always have a control with the experimental sample, they need to be processed together.
